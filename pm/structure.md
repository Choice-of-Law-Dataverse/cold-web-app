Creating a web application with Flask as the backend and a frontend framework involves setting up a structured environment where both parts can efficiently work together. Here's a general directory structure and layout that you can use to organize your Flask application alongside a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.

## Suggested Directory Structure
Below is a suggested directory structure that segregates the backend and frontend code efficiently, ensuring easy manageability as both parts of the application grow:

```{lua}
/my-web-app
|-- /backend
|   |-- /app
|   |   |-- __init__.py     # Initialize Flask app
|   |   |-- /routes         # Flask routes
|   |   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |   |-- views.py
|   |   |-- /models         # Database models
|   |   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |   |-- models.py
|   |   |-- /services       # Business logic
|   |   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |   |-- service.py
|   |   |-- /static         # Static files served by Flask
|   |   |   |-- /css
|   |   |   |-- /js
|   |   |   |-- /img
|   |   |-- /templates      # Jinja2 templates for Flask
|   |   |   |-- layout.html
|   |   |   |-- index.html
|   |   |-- config.py       # Configuration settings
|   |-- requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
|   |-- run.py              # Entry point to start the Flask app
|-- /frontend
|   |-- /src                # All source code for the UI
|   |   |-- /components     # UI components
|   |   |-- /services       # Services to connect to backend
|   |   |-- App.js
|   |   |-- index.js
|   |-- package.json        # Node.js project and dependencies
|   |-- webpack.config.js   # Bundling and optimization settings
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
```

## Backend - Flask
1. /app Directory: This directory contains your Flask application.
    - __init__.py: Initializes your Flask application and brings together other components.
    - /routes: Contains all your route definitions.
    - /models: Houses your SQLAlchemy models if you're interacting with a database.
    - /services: Business logic layer where data manipulation or operations are defined.
    - /static and /templates: Static assets and HTML templates for Flask. While most of the frontend will be handled by your chosen framework, these are useful for error pages or initial server-side rendering.
2. run.py: This is the startup script for your Flask application. It imports the app and runs it.

### Architecture of the backend

#### Prompts
```
I have a postgres database, which has regular tables, one-to-many relationships between tables as well as many-to-many relationships stored in junction tables. I need to build a web app which fulfills the following requirements:
- it has a search bar that takes user input and transforms it into keywords that are used to query the database
- relevant results contain of rows from all queried tables in the database. They are returned in a list-like display.
- when an entry in a relevant row is an NA value, this specific entry is not displayed while the other values from the same row are still shown.
- when an entry in a relevant row is a reference id to the row of another table, depending on the table being referenced I need to define another column in this referenced table from which the value will be displayed instead of the reference id.
- when the id of a relevant row is found in a junction table, the related table found through the associated id will be searched for a specified column and this value will be added to the list-like data display.
Use Flask as a main engine and html, css, and if necessary js to get this done. The focus for now is the backend. The frontend is a bridge to be crossed at a later point.
```
```
Lets go one more abstraction level up and tell me what components I need to fulfill my previously set requirements without considering implementation in code.
```

#### Components
0. **Setup**: Flask to create and run the web server, handle requests, integrate with other components like the database
    - Database Connection Function
        - Purpose: Establish and manage connections to the PostgreSQL database.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Open and close connections to ensure efficient use of resources.
            - Use a connection pooler to manage multiple connections simultaneously for better performance.
    - Search Route Handler
        - Purpose: Serve as the main endpoint for receiving search requests from the frontend.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Receive search parameters from a GET or POST request.
            - Call the search query function and pass the user input.
            - Receive the formatted results and return them to the user, likely in JSON format for easy frontend integration.
    - Error Handling Function
        - Purpose: Provide a centralized error management mechanism to handle and log errors gracefully.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Catch exceptions during database operations or data processing.
            - Log error details for debugging and monitoring.
            - Return user-friendly error messages or error codes to the frontend.
    - Database Schema Validation Function
        - Purpose: Validate that the database schema matches the expected structure required for the queries to function correctly.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Periodically check the schema integrity.
            - Ensure that all required tables and columns exist and have the correct data types.
1. **Search Query Processor**: (1) Input Parsing: This component takes user input from the search bar, processes it (possibly cleaning and splitting into keywords), and prepares it for querying the database. (2) Query Construction: Based on the processed input, this component constructs SQL queries that can handle like searches (for partial matches), exact matches, and logical conditions across multiple tables.
    - Search Query Function
        - Purpose: Handle incoming search requests, process the user's input, and generate appropriate SQL queries.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Parse the user input to extract keywords or criteria.
            - Construct dynamic SQL queries based on the parsed input, considering safety measures to prevent SQL injection.
            - Execute the queries against the database.
2. **Result Formatter**: Data Fetching and Transformation: Once data is queried from the database, this component transforms the raw data into a more useful format. This includes: (1) Handling NA Values: Removing or replacing NA values so they are not displayed. (2) Resolving Foreign Keys: For foreign key values, fetching the corresponding display values from the referenced tables. (3) Many-to-Many Relationships: When an ID appears in a junction table, fetching additional related data as specified.
    - Data Formatting Function
        - Purpose: Format the raw query results before sending them to the user.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Check for NA values in the result set and omit or replace them as necessary.
            - Resolve foreign key references by replacing IDs with meaningful data from related tables.
            - Handle many-to-many relationships by fetching related data via junction tables.
    - Reference Data Resolution Function
        - Purpose: Fetch and replace foreign key IDs with corresponding values from referenced tables.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Determine which table and column to query based on the foreign key.
            - Execute a sub-query to fetch the relevant data from the determined table.
            - Return the fetched value to replace the original ID in the results.
    - Many-to-Many Relation Handler Function
        - Purpose: Manage the extraction of data from tables linked through a junction table.
        - Basic Tasks:
            - Identify the related tables and columns involved in a many-to-many relationship via the junction table.
            - Query the related tables to gather additional information needed for the results.
            - Integrate this data into the main query results.
3. **Data Display Logic**: Result Presentation: Defines how the results are presented to the user. While initially this might be simple JSON via Flask, eventually it could evolve into a more structured HTML/CSS presentation with JavaScript enhancements.
4. **Experimental Frontend**: First scaffolding to show the data from the backend.

## Frontend - Framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
1. /src Directory: This is where all the frontend source files reside.
    - /components: React components or similar entities in other frameworks.
    - /services: Functions to handle API requests to the Flask backend.
2. package.json: Manages frontend dependencies and scripts for building and running the frontend.
3. webpack.config.js: If using Webpack, this file configures how the frontend should be bundled and compiled.

## Top-Level Files
- .gitignore: This should include directories and files that should not be tracked by Git, such as node_modules, __pycache__, etc.
- README.md: Documentation for your application explaining how to install and run it.

## Development Tips
- Decouple Backend from Frontend: By keeping the backend and frontend code separate, it makes the application more modular and easier to manage. Each part can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
- Environment Management: Use environment variables and possibly different config files to manage settings between development, testing, and production.
- RESTful API: Implement a RESTful API in Flask to interact between the frontend and backend. This approach makes it easier to scale and manage different parts of the application.

By following this structure, you can ensure that your application remains organized and scalable, with clear separation of concerns between client-side and server-side logic.
