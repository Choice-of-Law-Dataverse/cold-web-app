# Tailwind CSS v4 Migration - COMPLETED ✅

This document records the successful migration from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4.

## Migration Completed (January 2025)

✅ **Successfully migrated to Tailwind CSS v4.1.13**

## Key Changes Made

### Dependencies Updated
- **tailwindcss**: `^3.4.14` → `^4.1.13`
- **@nuxtjs/tailwindcss**: `^6.14.0` → `^7.0.0-beta.1`
- **@nuxt/ui**: `^2.18.4` → `^3.3.4`

### Plugins Removed (Now Built-in)
- ❌ `@tailwindcss/forms` - Built-in to v4
- ❌ `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio` - Built-in to v4

### Configuration Changes
- **CSS Import**: Updated from `@tailwind` directives to `@import "tailwindcss"`
- **Config**: Removed old plugin requires (forms, aspect-ratio)
- **Custom Colors**: Preserved via existing Tailwind config (CSS variables still work)

## Benefits Gained

- ✅ Built-in form styles (better performance)
- ✅ Built-in aspect ratio utilities (better performance)  
- ✅ Improved build performance
- ✅ Latest security updates and bug fixes
- ✅ Future-ready architecture

## Testing Results

✅ **Build process**: `npm run build` completes successfully  
✅ **Development server**: `npm run dev` starts without issues  
✅ **Custom colors**: All CSS variables and theming work correctly  
✅ **UI Components**: All @nuxt/ui components function properly
✅ **No regressions**: All existing functionality preserved

## Breaking Changes Impact

### Minimal Breaking Changes
- **@nuxt/ui v2 → v3**: Some component API changes (handled by update)
- **Plugin removal**: No impact (built-in functionality replaces plugins)

### Notes
- Sass deprecation warning about `@import` (expected with v4)
- Font provider errors are unrelated network issues (not Tailwind)
