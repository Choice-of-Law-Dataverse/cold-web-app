## What is CoLD?

**CoLD is a Repository**  
CoLD contains carefully curated private international law data, helping experts stay up to date on legal changes across the world.

**CoLD is a Community**  
Our main objective is to transform data points into knowledge through collaboration within a community.

**CoLD is Open Research**  
The Dataverse promotes sharing, preserving, citing, exploring and analyzing research data on choice of law. CoLD is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0<img

The core subject of CoLD is of significant importance to the resolution of real-world international commercial disputes. Rules of law chosen by the parties (or otherwise identified as applicable by judges or arbitrators) can significantly impact the outcome of a case before courts or an arbitral tribunal, and a framework on how to choose these rules is therefore necessary.

Undertaking research in this area across fragmented databases is very burdensome to legal practitioners and scholars. When a dispute arises, clients ultimately bear the costs. These costs stand to be reduced—and access to justice thereby stands to be improved—where legal practitioners have access to a Dataverse.

The discipline in which this research project is inserted is private international law, also known as conflict of laws. It refers to a set of rules of law (of domestic, regional, international or supranational nature) that can determine (i) which court has jurisdiction and (ii) which law governs a given legal transaction or dispute. Our research is concerned solely with the second aspect, i.e., [the determination of the applicable law](/learn/faq).
