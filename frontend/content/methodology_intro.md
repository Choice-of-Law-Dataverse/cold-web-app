## What’s the Methodology Behind CoLD?

In order to systematize diverse rules and case law decisions in a uniform manner, [comparative law methodology](/learn?tab=methodology#questionnaire) is applied. A high-quality database is the result of comprehensive global research efforts on the topic of choice of law, and the ultimate goal is to add more data points to the main dataset. Information will be “in motion”, constantly updated and connected to the users.

Our specific objectives are the following:

- To expand the scope of data collection to more African, Asian and Latin American countries.
- To update the existing information.
- To translate relevant data points into English.
- To present the information in a systematic and orderly manner.
- To design a user-friendly online platform as a sustainable data-sharing strategy.
- To provide a comprehensive overview of national, regional, supranational, and international rules and approaches to choice of law.
- To determine good practices which may be transferable to other jurisdictions, notably where a body of rules is not consolidated and courts have not adopted a position on a given choice of law issue.
- To identify convergent trends in party autonomy across the five continents.
- To forecast new directions regarding the future of transnational rules on conflict of laws.
