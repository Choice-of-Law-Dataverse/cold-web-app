The answers are classified into four categories.

1. **Yes**. Legal authorities confirm a positive answer to the issue, or there are legal provisions or court decisions that point in this direction.
2. **No**. Legal authorities provide a negative answer to the issue, or there are legal provisions or court decisions indicating so.
3. **Unclear**. The position on the topic is divided.
4. **No information**. Jurisdiction does not cover this question.

The answers might also indicate multiple interpretation criteria. If the answer is logically precluded or does not apply to the context of a given legal system, the answer is displayed as "Not applicable".
